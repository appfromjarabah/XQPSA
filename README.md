* A desktop application is developed using [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org) framework.

* The application allows users to choose the problem from a 4-queen problem to a 13-queen problem (10 cases), then display all possible solutions (queens locations) on the chessboard.

* The application displays all solutions for all cases at the same time (about 2s while preparing the chessboard).

* Cases solutions are stored into lists embedded with the application code lines.

* We used the OR tools solution to the [N-Queens Problem](https://developers.google.com/optimization) from Google to prepare the data of the cases' solutions.
