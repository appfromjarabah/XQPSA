- An open-source desktop application is developed using the [Pygame framework](https://www.pygame.org).

- The application allows users to choose the problem from a 4-queen problem to a 13-queen problem (10 cases), then display all possible solutions (queens locations) on the chessboard.

- The application displays all solutions for all cases at the same time (about 5s while preparing the chessboard).

- Cases solutions are stored into lists embedded with the application code lines.

- We used the [OR-Tools Solution to The N-Queens Problem](https://developers.google.com/optimization) from Google to prepare the data of the cases' solutions.
